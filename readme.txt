# code_louisville_project_fewd2021
This is the repo for for the project that I made during Code Louisville - Front End Web Dev 2021

Its is a concept for a podcast website.

Its is broken into 4 total sections with one external link that leads to amazon.com(this is supposed to represent a store front for the podcast merch)

The first section is the introduction area(header). This is where the user can see what the website is for and a logo detailing the podcast.
    Below that in the same section is a nav bar with 4 buttons: About, Meet the Hosts, Listen now, and Shop. Each of these buttons are hyperlinks to IDs attached to the different     h1 elements nested in each section. You will also notice that smooth scrolling has been applied to the entire page for a better user experience.
    
About section
    This section is where the user can read what the podcast is about. There is a "Back to Top" hyperlink at the bottom of this section that will smooth scroll back up to the top     of the webpage
    
Meet the Hosts section
   This section is designed to meet the hosts of the podcast. Here the headshots of the hosts are visivle and styled with Flexbox to contain the images, host names and bio to make    it more readable and less confusing to the user. This section too has a "Back to Top" hyperlink that functions the same way as the about section
  

Listen Now section
  This section informs the user that they can listen to the podcast via four different links. Each link points to a different source where they can find this podcast. This section   also has the above "Back to Top" button and functions the same way
  
  
Lastly there is a sign up button run by JavaScript that opens a form that asks users if they would like to provide their email address to receive updates on future podcast information
